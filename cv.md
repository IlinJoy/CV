## About Me
Hi! I'm a frontend developer with a background in graphic design. I want to make websites that are not only nice to look at but also have convenient and easy-to-use interfaces, with clean and well-structured code. In my free time, I like to play video games, read books, or go hiking.

I'm always happy to chat or work together. Feel free to reach out!

    case percentOfSuccess >= 60:
      return `Not bad! Now you have a chance to learn ${chosenSkills} next year.`;

    case percentOfSuccess >= 40:
    return `May be you should not dive into ${chosenSkills}.`;
